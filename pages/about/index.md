Hi there, my name is Leonard Kioi. I'm a software developer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I aim to write code that is simple, clean
and maintainable. My favorite tools for this are Python, Javascript and now also Kotlin. Here you will find my projects, thoughts
on software craftsmanship etc. Besides software development I also like cycling so you will find some posts about that here too.

Feel free to contact me through email: lenny.kinyanjui.lk[at]gmail.com
