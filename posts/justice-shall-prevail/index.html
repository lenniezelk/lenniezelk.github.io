<p>I feel sad when I think about the corruption in my country. Kenya has so much potential but the looting of public resources has led to so much underdevelopment and suffering. I have been reading the book of Habakkuk for the past few days and i really related to the old testament prophet. In his time, his people were suffering under a foreign power. In my time, my people suffer under corrupt leaders.</p>
<p>In <code>Habakkuk 1:2</code>, he cries to God:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nv">How</span> <span class="nv">long</span>, <span class="nv">Lord</span>, <span class="nv">must</span> <span class="nv">I</span> <span class="nv">cry</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nv">help</span>? <span class="nv">But</span> <span class="nv">you</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="nv">not</span> <span class="nv">listen</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nv">I</span> <span class="k">call</span> <span class="nl">out</span> <span class="nv">to</span> <span class="nv">you</span>, <span class="nv">Violence</span><span class="o">!</span> <span class="nv">But</span> <span class="nv">you</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="nv">not</span> <span class="nv">deliver</span><span class="o">!</span> 
</pre>


<p>I feel the same way, our country has suffered under corrupt leaders, one after the other, scandal after scandal. My heart cries out to God, how long must we suffer under these wicked people who don't care who gets hurt by their actions. They steal from medical funds and money meant for primary school children, they kill directly and indirectly. During the general elections they incite the people to violence.</p>
<p>In <code>Habakkuk 1:4</code>, he says:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">Therefore</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">law</span> <span class="k">is</span> <span class="n">paralyzed</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">justice</span> <span class="n">never</span> <span class="n">prevails</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">wicked</span> <span class="n">hem</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">righteous</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">so</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">justice</span> <span class="k">is</span> <span class="n">perverted</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre>


<p>In my country, politicians loot public resources, they are charged in court, post bail and leave. The trial begins but no one is ever convicted. They continue to make public appearances and even run for public office again. There is a lack of political will to bring change. Our institutions tasked with fighting corruption seem powerless to do anything. I remember the other day reading an article in one of the local newspapers that the EACC has only recovered 500,000 KES of looted money, yet billions have been stolen. Cases remain in court for years. I remember my mom and her siblings have a case in court for over eighteen years and its still not done. People can steal and not worry about the consequences, they are able to bribe judges to get favorable sentences. They can bribe court officers so the documents disappear. Justice truly is perverted here. Politics has become so lucrative, people are willing to do anything to anyone so as to get elected or appointed to public office. I had some business dealings with someone and during a casual conversation, I brought up that I was once caught with a traffic offence and was fined in court. He told me if we knew each other then he would have been able to help me, I would have given him <code>ya macho</code> and walked scott free. He works at the court offices.</p>
<p>I like the current DPP, Noordin Haji and the DCI, George Kinoti, they are are ordering arrests and prosecution of high profile individuals. I hope the courts wont let them down. I always remember Haji in my prayers. I need to remember to pray for Kinoti too.</p>
<p>In <code>Habakkuk 2:3</code>, God says:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">For</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">revelation</span> <span class="nv">awaits</span> <span class="nv">an</span> <span class="nv">appointed</span> <span class="nv">time</span><span class="c1">;</span>
    <span class="nv">it</span> <span class="nv">speaks</span> <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="nv">and</span> <span class="nv">will</span> <span class="nv">not</span> <span class="nv">prove</span> <span class="nv">false</span>.
<span class="nv">Though</span> <span class="nv">it</span> <span class="nv">linger</span>, <span class="k">wait</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nv">it</span><span class="c1">;</span>
    <span class="nv">it</span>[<span class="nv">a</span>] <span class="nv">will</span> <span class="nv">certainly</span> <span class="nv">come</span>
    <span class="nv">and</span> <span class="nv">will</span> <span class="nv">not</span> <span class="nv">delay</span>.
</pre>


<p>Reading from <code>2:2</code> to the end of the chapter, God is passing judgement on the wicked and in <code>2:3</code> God says it will come to pass. We have the advantage of hindsight, we know the Assyrians were overthrown by the Babylonians so God's word came to pass. In <code>2:9</code> God specifically speaks to those who build their house by unjust gain. This is our corrupt politicians, corrupt judges, corrupt police officers and anyone else who is corrupt. I believe one day God will bring justice to our country, things will change for our people. Ultimately, all sin will be punished on judgement day so no one will escape.</p>
<p><code>Habakkuk 3:16</code>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>...
<span class="nv">Yet</span> <span class="nv">I</span> <span class="nv">will</span> <span class="k">wait</span> <span class="nv">patiently</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">day</span> <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="nv">calamity</span>
    <span class="nv">to</span> <span class="nv">come</span> <span class="nv">on</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">nation</span> <span class="nv">invading</span> <span class="nv">us</span>.
